  abstract: >
      The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) shifts the complementary market for passenger transport from oil to electricity. We develop and estimate a joint equilibrium model of the German electricity and automobile markets, emphasizing the timing of EV charging, as electricity generation costs and pollution vary intraday. Our results show that under Germany’s current electricity pricing scheme, EVs create a significant pecuniary externality: electricity expenses rise by €0.66 for every €1 spent charging. Exposing charging to wholesale price variation eliminates the pecuniary externality, makes EVs greener, and increases adoption—a triple dividend.

      We develop a two-stage game in which competing airlines first choose the networks of markets to serve in the first stage before competing in price in the second stage. Spillovers in entry decisions across markets are allowed, which accrue on the demand, marginal cost, and fixed cost sides. We show that the second-stage parameters are point identified, and we design a tractable procedure to set identify the first-stage parameters and to conduct inference. Further, we estimate the model using data from the domestic US airline market and find significant spillovers in entry. In a counterfactual exercise, we evaluate the 2013 merger between American Airlines and US Airways. Our results highlight that spillovers in entry and post-merger network readjustments play an important role in shaping post-merger outcomes.

      This paper develops a structural model of endogenous product attribute choice in the presence of indirect network effects to study electric vehicle (EV) subsidies. Using data on the German EV market, I find that a support scheme almost doubled EV sales but substantially affected the price and driving range of EVs. When designing subsidies, these adjustments create a trade-off between optimizing different policy objectives. Large purchase subsidies maximize EV sales whereas large charging station subsidies maximize consumer and total surplus. The results suggest that maximizing EV sales can lead to unintended consequences in the form of price and range adjustments.

      We estimate a structural model of electricity retailer choices accommodating various sources of consumer inertia, including inattention, limited information, switching costs, and product differentiation. The model disentangles the relative importance of different frictions. We estimate our model using individual-level data of all retailer switches and queries on a price comparison website in New Zealand. We find that price comparison tools strongly impact market structure and consumer surplus. However, mandating all consumers search for alternatives has stronger effects on market structure and consumer surplus gains. Our results help policymakers design policies that improve consumer choices and effective competition in retail markets.

- title: "Fueling Electrification: The Impact of Gas Prices on Hybrid Car Usage"
  pdflink: "/pdf/phev_usage.pdf"
  coauthors: "Laura Grigolon and Eunseong Park"
  abstract: >
      We use micro-level data on fuel consumption, mileage, and travel mode to study plug-in hybrid drivers' responses to fuel prices. When fuel prices rise, plug-in hybrids reduce fuel consumption more than gasoline and diesel cars. They do not reduce their mileage but increase electric recharging. As the share of kilometers driven in electric mode by plug-in hybrids is only half the official test cycle value, fuel prices are effective in improving the environmental performance of these vehicles.
